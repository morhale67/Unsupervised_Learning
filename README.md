# Unsupervised_Learning
This is a brief description of a study that compares various data reduction algorithms and clustering methods for unsupervised learning.
The data reduction algorithms included in the study are PCA, MDS, ICA, t-SNE, Isomap, Laplacian, and LLE.
The clustering methods tested are K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN.

This work was completed as part of a course on unsupervised learning at Bar Ilan University's Mathematics Faculty.
